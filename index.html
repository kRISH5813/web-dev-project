            <h2>let's learn</h2>
            <p>Starting to play Clash of Clans as a beginner can be an exciting experience. Here are some steps to help
                you get started:</p>
            <ul>
                <h3>Complete the Tutorial: </h3>
                <p>When you start the game, you will go through a tutorial that will introduce you to the basic
                    mechanics of the game. Pay close attention to this tutorial as it will help you understand how to
                    build your village, train troops, and attack other players.</p>
                <h3>Build Your Village: </h3>
                <p>In Clash of Clans, you are the chief of a village. Start by building and upgrading your defenses,
                    such as cannons, archer towers, and walls. Also, build resource buildings like gold mines and elixir
                    collectors to gather resources.</p>
                <h3>Train Troops: </h3>
                <p>You will need troops to attack other players' villages and defend your own. Train different types of
                    troops in your barracks and army camps to create a well-balanced army.</p>
                <h3>Join a Clan: </h3>
                <p>Joining a clan is a great way to socialize with other players, receive help and advice, and
                    participate in clan wars. Look for an active clan that suits your play style.</p>
                <h3>Participate in Clan Wars: </h3>
                <p>Clan wars are a major part of Clash of Clans. Coordinate with your clanmates to strategize and attack
                    other clans to earn loot and clan perks.</p>
                <h3>Save Gems: </h3>
                <p>Gems are the premium currency in Clash of Clans. Try to save your gems for important things like
                    builder huts or boosting your resource production.</p>
                <h3>Upgrade Defenses and Troops: </h3>
                <p>As you progress in the game, focus on upgrading your defenses and troops to make your village
                    stronger and more formidable in battles.</p>
            </ul>
